title: Bicycle a day
---

Ok, here's my idea. I'll try to **create something every day**, well, probably not every day =) Even not every week, but the point is to converge to single something per day velocity.

That could be anything, not only code, something silly or pretty advanced, a drawing or new trampoline trick, maybe some electronic device or useless formula. 

I just do what comes to my mind **without trying to provide quality or solid impression** and **document it**, so evidence of that is public. I believe this could encourage me to try more things and slap my pride if I waste my time.

Let's see what it gives. I'm goood at making lists, but I hate record-keeping, so this might as a lot of other efforts vanish in oblivion (but provide great prolonging effect, i.e. I continue to do things, but too lazy to keep the records).


So, bicycle for today is [maniak-dobrii.com/bad](http://maniak-dobrii.com/bad) category addition.
